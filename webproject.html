    <p><b>"I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference."</b> Hello, my name is Carlo. Welcome to my website. This website is about discovering joy and contentment in the muddled mess of life. It’s about finding what gets you out of bed in the morning, letting go of what weighs you down, and becoming a better version of yourself. When I am away from my computer, I enjoy spending quality time with my barbells and kettlebells <em>(Turkish get up anyone?)</em>. I also relish the time I spend outdoors: kayaking, fishing, hiking, backpacking, and mountain biking are some of my favorite activities to do (when the weather is decent).
    <br>
    <br>
    Hiking though, is my favorite activity. I find hiking to be therapeutic. That may sound strange, especially being that by the time I get off the trail, I’m typically covered in scrapes, bruises/blisters, and bug bites. But despite the physical ailments coming off the trail, I always emerge better than I went in.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Here’s the irony:</b> no matter the difficulty of the hike, the pain, the frustrations, by the time I am sitting in my truck headed home, I already miss the mountains.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the beginning, I hated hiking. I liked the idea of being a hiker, but when I was on the trail, I just wanted to get to my destination and be done. But then, something happened. I’m not sure what switched in me, or exactly when it happened, but at some point two years ago, I developed a hunger for the trail. Hiking for me has developed into something so much greater than an outing that allows me to see something beautiful. It has become my passion. It has become something I do to cope, to refresh, and to heal. I have begun to hike to heal, from everyday life, as well as life’s tragedies that will forever follow me.

I hope you will enjoy them and see you at the trail!</p>
